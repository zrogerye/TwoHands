# TwoHands
## Second-hand Items, Straight To Your Hands

## Developed by: Roger Ye, Karner David, Nathan Nguyen, Cara Ung

#### There are many places on campus where surplus items are deposited for anyone to take and reuse, though, many students are unaware of these locations. These objects are often in good condition to be reused and/or repurposed, but they eventually end up in landfills since people rarely know of their existence. Our app aims to combat excessive waste by first starting small and targeting the issues of waste on campus. The app make the aforementioned surplus centers and items more known and accessible to students on campus by providing a catalogue of current surplus items and their location. To have an item listed, a representative from a certain university department would contact us with images of the item, the surplus location of the item, and the item's condition. The item would then be listed onto the the catalogue for users of the app to find.


We have decided to only allow university representatives, professors, and employees to list items, and we do so for a specific reason. We trust the university to leave objects only in the designated surplus locations. If we allowed anyone to list items, they may leave the item in an undesignated area at their convenience, which may be counterproductive to the goal of this app since they would be placing their unwanted objects in the public. 


## Here is a quick demo of our application.
